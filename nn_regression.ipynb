This process, which is called *forward propagation*, is repeated for all neurons and layers until the output $\\textbf{o} = (o_1, o_2, ...)$ in the final *output layer* is obtained. Already at this level one of the main characteristics of (multi-layer) neural networks becomes clear - namely, the ability to learn complex features from the initial input. This ability to learn new representations that become more abstract the deeper the network is, i.e., the more hidden layers it has, distinguishes neural networks from other, \"standard\" machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees). \n",

    "To illustrate the usefulness of softmax activation functions, let us consider the case of crystal-structure classification.

For instance, possible assignments could be face-centered-cubic, body-centered-cubic, diamond or hexagonal closed packed - a collection of structures that covers more than 80% of the elemental solids. More thorough explanations on deep learning applied to crystal-structure classification can be found  [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05169-6). When applying the multilayer perceptron architecture that we introduced above, each of the four output neurons correspond to a specific crystal structure.

    "\n",
    "*Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different ‚Äúthinned‚Äù networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.*\n",

    "\n",
    "* Feel free to change hyperparameters by hand to get a feeling for them and possibly to improve model performance. In case training takes too long, reduce the neural-network size and/or the number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare the results of this tutorial to the ones in the [original reference](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjcompumats201628?report=reader) (Table 1). If they are worse, try to explain what could be improved (tip: think about how the information on inorganic compounds is encoded in \"ElemNet\" and compare it to the one of the reference. Also have a look at [this documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)). Furthermore, even if the performance (as, for instance, indicated by MSE) is worse, why are neural networks still useful / why do they provide an advantage compared to other \"standard\" machine learning methods (hint: Figure 6 of the original ElemNet reference and/or google \"Representation learning\")?\n",

    "* (Optional) Inform yourself about other ways to visualize the data such as box and violin plots. The seaborn documentation is a useful resource for this. For materials science related visualizations, have a look at the figures in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7639/ab077b/meta), especially Fig. 3-6."
