In this tutorial we will use the ElemNet neural network architecture (https://github.com/NU-CUCIS/ElemNet) to predict the volume per atom of inorganic compounds, where the open quantum materials database (OQMD) is used as a resource (specifically, the data is taken from Ward et. al., npj Comput. Mater. 2, 16028 (2016)).

Installation:

An online version can be found at https://nomad-lab.eu/AItutorials .

Alternatively, you may create a virtual environment (python 3.7, with conda) and then install the requirements via

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

After this, you can start a jupyter notebook and run the tutorial.
